# Oracle Aggregator

Example Oracle Aggregator that can be used with Blend pools. This contract allows one Blend pool to access multiple oracle prices sources from one location via `lastprice` method.

### Supported Oracles

This Oracle Aggregator contract makes a few assumptions about the oracles it can support:

* Oracle must have the same base asset as the aggregator (e.g. USD)
* Oracle must support SEP-40 `lastprice(asset: Address)`, and it should return the most recently reported price by the oracle
* If `lastprice(asset: Address)` can return `None` intermittently, like in the event of the most recent round being missed, the oracle must support SEP-40 `price(asset: Address, timestamp: u64)`, and it should return the most recently reported price on or before the timestamp given

### Config

The oracle aggregator uses some global configuration defined through the constructor:

* admin `Address` - The admin has the ability to add additional assets to the oracle aggregator. This should be done cautiosly, as they can never be removed or edited.
* base `Asset` - The base asset the oracle aggregator will report prices in
* decimals `u32` - The decimals the oracle aggregator will report prices in
* max_age `u64` - The maximum age (in seconds) of a fetched price the oracle aggregator will return from the current ledger timestamp

Each asset that is not supported by the default oracle can be added with the following config:

**Asset Config**
* asset `Asset` - The asset to be used when fetching the price
* oracle_id `Address` - The address of the source oracle
* decimals `u32` - The decimals of the source oracle
* resolution `u32` - The resolution of the source oracle (in seconds)

Up to 20 additional assets can be supported.

### Last Price Method

The aggregator will attempt to fetch the assets price via `lastprice` first. Some oracles opt to return `None` if the latest round did not reach consensus, or there was an issue. In this case, the aggregator will attempt to call `price` for each `resolution` period since the current timestamp, up to the `max_age` of a price. If no price can be resolved that is at most `max_age` old, the aggregator will panic.
